B-tree slightly increase exec time with bigger l, while R-tree is much faster (200x) but 5x l causes 3x exec time. So we can imagine that at very large values of l, r-tree efficiency may become equal to b-tree.  
Because R-tree is good for finding close by elements, it is faster in this kind of N-dimensional searching where n > 1.  
In conclusion, for 2d search, r-tree is better than b tree.
