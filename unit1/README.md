# Project 1 README:
## Required files:
	some kind of .osm file
	edmonton.sql
	triggers.sql
	main.py
## Compilation and execution instructions
The main program file has been written in python 3 
main.py, edmonton.sql and the .osm file must reside in the same directory
The program can be run through a terminal window with the command 
```
python3 main.py
```
The user will then be prompted to enter in the name of the database that they wish to 
create, for example "Edmonton". This name is entered without .db at the end.
The user will then be prompted to enter the name of the .osm file that they wish to 
extract the data from. This too is entered without .osm at the end.
The resulting db will be placed in the current directory.
