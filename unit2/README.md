# Project 2 README:

- The distance function is held in the file [common.py](common.py)
- All code is executed in the directory that it resides in

## Q1
- Question 1 is run with the code from [q1.py](q1.py)
- The command line required to run this code from a lab machine is
- python3 q1.py <database.db> <node 1> <node 2>
- We use the haversine formula for the distance calculation as it provides us with
the most accurate answer when compared to other formulas. It also was far easier to 
implement the haversine formula then other possible formulas

## Q2
- Question 2 is run with code from [q2.py](q2.py)
- The command line required to run this code from a lab machine is
- python3 q2.py <database.db> <key=value> <key=value> ...
- Keys cannot have spaces in them, however values can have spaces.
- There is no limit to how many key,value pairs that can be entered

## Q3
- Question 3 is run with code from [q3.py](q3.py)
- The command line required to run this code from a lab machine is 
- python3 q3.py <database.db> <way.id> 

## Q4
- Question 4 is run with code from [Q4.py](Q4.py) 
- The command line required to run this code from a lab machine is 
- python3 Q4.py <database.db> <key=value> <key=value> ...
- There is no limit to how many key,value pairs that can be entered

## Q5
- Question 5 is run with code from [Q5.py](Q5.py)
- The command line required to run this code from a lab machine is 
- python3 Q5.py <database.db> <data.tsv>

## Q6
- Question 6 is run with code from [Q6.py](Q6.py)
- The command line required to run this code from a lab machine is 
- python3 Q6.py <database.db> <data.tsv>
